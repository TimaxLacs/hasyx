Hasyx provides a robust starting point and a set of tools for building applications using Next.js (App Router), Hasura, and strong authentication patterns. It simplifies setup with JWT-based authentication via NextAuth.js, a secure GraphQL proxy to Hasura, direct WebSocket support for subscriptions, and a powerful dynamic query generator.

## Technologies Used

Hasyx takes responsibility for:

*   Setting up a universal, ws/serverless compatible Next.js environment.
*   Proxying client connections to Hasura through `/api/graphql`, eliminating the need to expose Hasura JWTs to the client and relying solely on NextAuth.js for authorization.
*   Providing access via both the native ApolloClient and a custom [`Hasyx`](HASYX.md) class for interacting with Hasura.
*   A fully configured NextAuth.js integration supporting multiple authentication methods (including Credentials, Google, Yandex, with others like GitHub planned).
*   Maintaining backward compatibility for UI components under `hasyx/components/ui/*` (generated via shadcn/ui) to minimize refactoring needs in downstream projects.
*   Ensuring seamless compatibility between Vercel deployments and Hasura Cloud/Server.
*   Structuring the `./lib/**` directory so its contents can be directly imported as if from an npm package, allowing the project to function as both a standalone application and a reusable library.
*   Pre-configuring Jest for TypeScript testing of files within the `./lib` directory.
*   Integrating Resend for sending email verification messages (when `RESEND_API_KEY` is set).
*   [Coming Soon] Preparing Capacitor for building cross-platform applications (Android, iOS, Desktop, Browser Extensions, etc.).

Applying best development practices from the listed ecosystems, we have combined these libraries into a single framework for rapid deployment.

## üöÄ Quick Start

Get your Next.js project integrated with Hasura and authentication in minutes!

1.  **Install Hasyx:**
    ```bash
    npm install hasyx
    # or
    yarn add hasyx
    # or
    pnpm add hasyx
    ```

2.  **Initialize Hasyx:**
    Run the init command in your project root. This will set up necessary API routes, configurations, and patch your Next.js project for WebSocket support.
    ```bash
    npx hasyx init
    ```
    See the `init` command documentation below for details on created files.

    If you need to reinstall and replace ALL files, including those that normally wouldn't be overwritten, use:
    ```bash
    npx hasyx init --reinit
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in your project root (or configure environment variables in your deployment platform). Fill in the necessary details for Hasura, NextAuth, and any OAuth providers you plan to use. See the "Environment Variables" section below for a full example and detailed setup instructions.

4.  **Setup Database & Schema:**
    *   Create your database tables and relationships. You can adapt the example migrations in the `hasyx` package under `migrations/hasyx/` ([up.ts](./migrations/hasyx/up.ts), [down.ts](./migrations/hasyx/down.ts)). Place your migration scripts in a `migrations/<your_migration_name>/` directory in your project root.
    *   Apply migrations: `npx hasyx migrate`
    *   Generate Hasura schema JSON and TypeScript types: `npx hasyx schema`

5.  **Easy configure ColorMode, Session and Apollo with HasyxProvider:**
    Wrap your application layout (e.g., `app/layout.tsx`) with the Apollo Provider.
    ```tsx
    'use client'; // Layout must be client-side due to providers

    import { HasyxProvider } from "hasyx";
    import "./globals.css";

    export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
      return (
        <>
          <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
            <head />
            <body>
              <HasyxProvider>
                {children}
              </HasyxProvider>
            </body>
          </html>
        </>
      )
    }
    ```

6.  **Use Hasyx Client for Data:**
    Fetch, mutate, and subscribe to your Hasura data using Hasyx hooks and the Client class, which leverage a powerful query generator.
    ```tsx
    import { useClient, useQuery, useSubscription } from 'hasyx';

    function MyComponent() {
      // Get the Hasyx client instance
      const client = useClient();

      // Fetch users
      const { data: usersData, loading: usersLoading, error: usersError } = useQuery({
        table: 'users',
        returning: ['id', 'name', 'email'],
        where: { name: { _ilike: '%a%' } },
        limit: 10,
      });

      // Subscribe to user changes (using the hook)
      const { data: subData, loading: subLoading } = useSubscription({
        table: 'users',
        returning: ['id', 'name'],
        limit: 5,
        order_by: { created_at: 'desc' }
      });

      return <div onClick={async () => {
        const result = await client.insert({
          table: 'users',
          // Generator syntax for variables is used directly in client methods
          objects: [{ name: 'New User', email: 'new@example.com' }],
          returning: ['id'] // Return the ID of the new user
        });
        // Similarly, you can use:
        // await client.update({ table: 'users', where: { id: { _eq: userId } }, _set: { name: 'Updated Name' } });
        // await client.delete({ table: 'users', where: { id: { _eq: userId } } });
        // await client.select({ table: 'posts', returning: ['id', 'title'] });
      }}>
      
      // ... render your component using the fetched/subscribed data ...
    }
    ```
    Refer to [`GENERATOR.md`](GENERATOR.md) and [`HASYX.md`](HASYX.md) for detailed syntax.

7.  **Run Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npx hasyx dev
    ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è CLI Commands

Hasyx provides a CLI tool (run via `npx hasyx <command>`) to simplify common tasks:

---

### `init`

Initializes Hasyx in your Next.js project. It copies necessary API routes, configuration files, and applies the `next-ws` patch for WebSocket support.

```bash
npx hasyx init
```

You can also use the `--reinit` flag to force replacement of all files, including those that would normally only be created if they don't exist:

```bash
npx hasyx init --reinit
```

**File Operations:**

*   üîÑ = Overwrites the file if it exists.
*   ‚ú® = Creates the file only if it does not exist (or always replaces it with `--reinit`).

**npm Scripts Setup:**

During initialization, Hasyx ensures that the following npm scripts are added to your project's package.json:

```json
"scripts": {
  "build": "NODE_ENV=production npx -y hasyx build",
  "unbuild": "npx -y hasyx unbuild",
  "start": "NODE_ENV=production npx -y hasyx start",
  "dev": "npx -y hasyx dev"
}
```

These scripts allow you to use standard npm commands (e.g., `npm run dev`, `npm run build`) in your project while leveraging Hasyx's enhanced functionality. The scripts automatically use the Hasyx CLI and apply the necessary environment variables.

**WebSocket Support:**

When running `init`, Hasyx automatically patches your Next.js project for WebSocket support:

*Note: GitHub workflow files are copied as examples and might need adjustment for your specific repository.*

---

### `dev`

Starts the Next.js development server (`next dev`).

```bash
npx hasyx dev
```

---

### `build`

Builds your Next.js application for production (`next build`).

```bash
npx hasyx build
```

---

### `start`

Starts the Next.js production server (`next start`). Requires a previous `build`.

```bash
npx hasyx start
```

---

### `migrate`

Finds and executes `up.ts` migration scripts located in subdirectories of `./migrations` (e.g., `./migrations/001_users/up.ts`, `./migrations/002_posts/up.ts`) in alphabetical order of the subdirectories.

```bash
npx hasyx migrate
```
It uses `npx tsx` to run the scripts. Ensure your migration scripts handle database connections and operations correctly. See [`migrations/hasyx/up.ts`](./migrations/hasyx/up.ts) for an example.

---

### `unmigrate`

Finds and executes `down.ts` migration scripts located in subdirectories of `./migrations` in **reverse** alphabetical order of the subdirectories.

```bash
npx hasyx unmigrate
```
It uses `npx tsx` to run the scripts. See [`migrations/hasyx/down.ts`](./migrations/hasyx/down.ts) for an example.

---

### `schema`

Generates the Hasura GraphQL schema and corresponding TypeScript types for use with the query generator and client hooks. It performs two steps:
1. Runs a script (internally `lib/hasura-schema.ts`) to fetch the introspection schema from your Hasura instance (`NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL`) and saves it to `./public/hasura-schema.json` in your project.
2. Runs `graphql-codegen` using the configuration (internally `lib/hasura-types.ts`) to generate TypeScript definitions based on the fetched schema, saving them to `./types/hasura-types.d.ts` in your project.

```bash
npx hasyx schema
```
Run this command whenever your Hasura database structure (tables, columns, relationships) changes.

---

### `events`

Synchronize Hasura event triggers with local definitions

- Option: `--init` - Create default event trigger definitions
- Option: `--clean` - Remove security headers from event definitions (they will be added automatically during sync)

The CLI automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file in your project root. This ensures that commands like `npx hasyx events` have access to your Hasura URL, admin secret, and other configuration.

---

## üîë Environment Variables

Configure Hasyx features by setting environment variables. Create a `.env` file in your project root or set them in your deployment environment. Features requiring specific variables (like OAuth providers or email sending) are automatically activated when the corresponding variables are set.

**Example `.env` File:**

```env
# ===== Test Configuration =====
# For testAuthorize() function in AUTH.md
TEST_TOKEN=anything

# ===== Hasura Configuration =====
# Required: URL of your Hasura GraphQL endpoint
NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL=https://your-project.hasura.app/v1/graphql
# Required for migrations, schema generation, and potentially backend operations if not using JWT auth for them.
HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET=your_strong_hasura_admin_secret
# Required if using JWT authentication mode with Hasura. MUST match Hasura's config.
HASURA_JWT_SECRET={\"type\":\"HS256\",\"key\":\"your_32_byte_or_longer_secret_key_for_hs256\"}
# Required for event triggers security.
HASURA_EVENT_SECRET=your_strong_hasura_event_secret

# ===== NextAuth.js Configuration =====
# Required: A strong secret for signing tokens, CSRF protection, etc.
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_super_secret_nextauth_key_32_chars_or_more

# ===== Deployment & Build Configuration =====
# Base URL for server-side operations and default NextAuth callbacks (OAuth, emails). 
# IMPORTANT: Set this to your canonical production URL (e.g., https://myapp.com) 
# or http://localhost:3000 for local dev.
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: Set the base path if deploying the site to a subdirectory (e.g., /my-app).
# For GitHub Pages, this is set automatically by the workflow based on your repo name.
# Leave blank or remove if deploying to the root.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH=

# Optional: URL of the *deployed* backend API for client-side builds (Capacitor, static export).
# If set, the client build will make API calls to this URL instead of relative paths.
# Defaults to NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL if not set.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_URL=

# Internal use: Set automatically by specific build scripts (e.g., build:client sets it to 'client').
# Do not set manually unless you know what you are doing.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TARGET=

# Optional: Controls WebSocket support for subscriptions (default: 1 = enabled)
# Set to 0 to disable WebSockets and use polling-based subscriptions instead.
# Particularly useful for serverless environments like Vercel where WebSockets are not supported.
# NEXT_PUBLIC_WS=1

# ===== OAuth Providers (Optional - Enable by setting credentials) =====
# --- Google ---
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_client_id.apps.googleusercontent.com
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_google_client_secret

# --- Yandex ---
# YANDEX_CLIENT_ID=your_yandex_client_id
# YANDEX_CLIENT_SECRET=your_yandex_client_secret

# ===== Email Provider (Optional - For passwordless or verification) =====
# Required if using EmailProvider or email features (like verification if implemented)
# RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_resend_api_key

# ===== Other =====
# NODE_ENV=development # Usually set automatically by Node/Next.js
```

### Configuration Details

#### Hasura (`NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL`, `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET`, `HASURA_JWT_SECRET`)

*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_HASURA_GRAPHQL_URL`: The **required** public endpoint for your Hasura instance. Hasyx uses this for client-side requests (via the proxy) and schema generation.
*   `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET`: **Required** for running migrations (`npx hasyx migrate`/`unmigrate`) and schema generation (`npx hasyx schema`) as these operations need admin privileges. It's also used by the GraphQL proxy *if* you configure the proxy to use the admin secret instead of forwarding user JWTs (not the default Hasyx setup). **Keep this secret secure and never expose it to the client.**
*   `HASURA_JWT_SECRET`: **Required** if your Hasura instance is configured to use JWT authentication mode. This variable must contain the *exact* same JWT configuration (type and key) as set in your Hasura environment variables. Hasyx uses this internally to generate Hasura-compatible JWTs based on the NextAuth session.
*   `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET`: **Required** for secure communication between Hasura and your event trigger handlers. This secret is automatically added as a header to event trigger requests from Hasura and verified by your handlers. It prevents unauthorized requests to your event trigger endpoints. Generate a strong, random string similar to NEXTAUTH_SECRET.

    *   **Migrations:** Define your database changes in `up.ts` and rollbacks in `down.ts` files within `./migrations/<n>/` directories (see [example up](./migrations/hasyx/up.ts), [example down](./migrations/hasyx/down.ts)). Run `npx hasyx migrate` to apply or `npx hasyx unmigrate` to revert.
    *   **Schema Updates:** After changing your database structure (and running migrations), update the local schema representation and types by running `npx hasyx schema`.

#### NextAuth.js (`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`)

*   `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: **Required** for securing sessions, signing JWTs, and CSRF protection. Generate a strong, random string (at least 32 characters). You can use `openssl rand -base64 32` to generate one.

* **For client-side builds using different domains (GitHub Pages, Capacitor, etc.):**
  * When deploying client-side builds (static export) that need to connect to your main backend API with NextAuth, the authentication is handled automatically via the `basePath` configuration in `SessionProvider`.
  * The client-side build will use the URL from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` or `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_URL` environment variables as the authentication API base.
  * The `SessionProvider` automatically detects when the app is running on a different domain and configures the authentication endpoints properly.
  * This allows authentication to work seamlessly across different environments (development, production) and deployments (client-side or server-side).

#### Deployment & Build (`NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TARGET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS`)

*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: **Required**. The canonical base URL of your application deployment. Used by NextAuth.js for OAuth redirects and email links, and as a default fallback for `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_URL`. Set it to your production domain (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`) or `http://localhost:3000` for local development.
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_PATH`: *Optional*. If you deploy your application to a subdirectory of a domain (e.g., `https://example.com/my-app`), set this variable to the subdirectory path (e.g., `/my-app`). Next.js will use this to correctly prefix asset paths (`/_next/...` becomes `/my-app/_next/...`) and links. **For GitHub Pages deployments**, the included workflow (`.github/workflows/nextjs.yml`) **automatically detects and sets this** based on your repository name, so you typically don't need to set it manually for GH Pages.
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAIN_URL`: *Optional*. Specifies the absolute URL of your deployed backend API. This is primarily used by **client-side builds** (`build:client` for Capacitor/static export). When `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TARGET` is set to `client`, API calls from the client (e.g., via Apollo Client configured in `HasyxProvider`) will be directed to this URL (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/api/graphql`) instead of relative paths (`/api/graphql`). If not set, it defaults to the value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`.
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_BUILD_TARGET`: *Internal Use*. This variable is set automatically by specific build scripts (like `npm run build:client` which sets it to `client`) to signal the type of build being performed. This allows `next.config.ts` and potentially other parts of the application (like `HasyxProvider`) to adjust their behavior, for example, by enabling `output: 'export'` or changing API endpoints. **Avoid setting this manually** unless you have a specific reason and understand the implications.
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS`: *Optional*. Controls whether WebSockets are used for GraphQL subscriptions. Defaults to `1` (enabled). Set to `0` to disable WebSockets and use polling-based subscriptions instead. This is particularly useful for serverless environments like Vercel where WebSockets are not supported. When disabled, subscriptions will automatically fall back to a polling implementation with deep equality checks to minimize unnecessary updates.

#### WebSocket Support

Hasyx uses WebSockets for real-time GraphQL subscriptions. To ensure proper WebSocket functionality:

- The `ws` package is installed automatically during project initialization
- A patch for Next.js WebSocket support is applied via `next-ws-cli`
- A `postinstall` script is added to your project to ensure the patch is applied after package installations

If you encounter WebSocket connection issues:

1. Verify the `ws` package is installed in your project's dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install ws@^8.18.1 --save
   ```

2. Make sure you have the necessary scripts in your package.json:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "postinstall": "npm run ws -- -y",
     "ws": "npx --yes next-ws-cli@latest patch -y"
   }
   ```

3. Apply the Next.js WebSocket patch manually:
   ```bash
   npx --yes next-ws-cli@latest patch -y
   ```

4. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS=1` is set in your environment (this is the default if not specified)

Common WebSocket error: `TypeError: bufferUtil.mask is not a function` indicates missing or incompatible WebSocket native modules. Running the patch and reinstalling the `ws` package typically resolves this issue.

### OAuth Providers (`GOOGLE_*`, `YANDEX_*`, etc.)

*   OAuth providers are automatically enabled in the NextAuth configuration provided by `hasyx init` if their corresponding `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` environment variables are set.
*   **Google:**
    1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
    2. Create a project or select an existing one.
    3. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials".
    4. Create "OAuth client ID", select "Web application".
    5. Add Authorized JavaScript origins (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
    6. Add Authorized redirect URIs: `YOUR_NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/api/auth/callback/google` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google`).
    7. Copy the Client ID and Client Secret into your `.env`.
*   **Yandex:**
    1. Go to the [Yandex OAuth Console](https://oauth.yandex.com/client/new).
    2. Register a new application.
    3. Choose "Web services".
    4. Add the Redirect URI: `YOUR_NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/api/auth/callback/yandex` (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/yandex`).
    5. Grant necessary permissions (e.g., access to email, profile info).
    6. Copy the ID and Password (Client Secret) into your `.env`.

#### Email Provider (`RESEND_API_KEY`)

*   If you plan to use features requiring email (like passwordless sign-in via the Email provider, or potentially email verification flows), you need to configure an email sending service.
*   Hasyx example setup might include integration with [Resend](https://resend.com).
*   If `RESEND_API_KEY` is set, related email functionality might be enabled.
    1. Sign up for Resend.
    2. Create an API Key in your Resend dashboard.
    3. Add the key to your `.env`.

## CLI Usage

```bash
# Install globally
npm install -g hasyx

# Or use with npx directly
npx hasyx <command>
```

### Available Commands

- `init` - Initialize hasyx in a Next.js project
  - Option: `--reinit` - Reinitialize all files, including those that normally would only be created if missing
- `dev` - Start the development server (with WebSocket support)
- `build` - Build the Next.js application
- `start` - Start the production server
- `build:client` - Build for client export (for Capacitor or similar)
- `migrate` - Run all migration scripts in alphabetical order
- `unmigrate` - Run all down migration scripts in reverse alphabetical order
- `schema` - Generate GraphQL schema from Hasura
- `events` - Synchronize Hasura event triggers with local definitions
  - Option: `--init` - Create default event trigger definitions
  - Option: `--clean` - Remove security headers from event definitions (they will be added automatically during sync)
- `assets` - Generate app icons and splash screens from logo.svg for web, Capacitor, and Electron apps
- `unbuild` - Remove compiled files (.js, .d.ts) from lib, components, and hooks directories, and clear build cache

The CLI automatically loads environment variables from the `.env` file in your project root. This ensures that commands like `npx hasyx events` have access to your Hasura URL, admin secret, and other configuration.

# Hasura Integration

## Event Triggers

Hasyx includes support for Hasura Event Triggers, which allow you to automate asynchronous logic when changes are made in the database. This is useful for implementing webhook-based workflows, sending notifications, or syncing data with external systems.

### How Event Triggers Work

1. You define event triggers in JSON files inside the `events/` directory.
2. Each file represents one event trigger and defines which table it watches and what operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) it responds to.
3. When those operations occur in Hasura, it sends a webhook request to your Next.js API route at `/api/events/[name]`.
4. Your handler in `app/api/events/[name]/route.ts` processes the webhook and performs any necessary actions.

### Using Event Triggers

1. **Initialize Event Triggers**
   ```bash
   npx hasyx events --init
   ```
   This creates default event trigger definitions for the `users` and `accounts` tables in the `events/` directory.

2. **Clean Event Trigger Definitions**
   ```bash
   npx hasyx events --clean
   ```
   This removes any security headers from your event trigger definitions, allowing them to be added automatically during synchronization.

3. **Deploy the Event Triggers to Hasura**
   ```bash
   npx hasyx events
   ```
   This reads the trigger definitions from the `events/` directory and creates or updates them in Hasura. Security headers with `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` are automatically added to each trigger.

4. **Security**
   For security, you should set `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` in your environment variables. This secret will be automatically added as a header to event trigger requests and verified by your handler.

   Important security considerations:
   
   - Always set `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` to a strong, random value in production environments
   - The secret header is automatically added to all event triggers during synchronization
   - In production mode, the `events` command will fail if `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` is not set
   - In production mode, requests without the correct secret will be denied automatically
   - Keep your `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` as secure as your `HASURA_ADMIN_SECRET`
   - The `hasyxEvent` wrapper handles all security verification automatically
   - Never expose your event handlers to public access without authentication
   - For local development, ensure your Hasura instance can reach your local server (use tools like ngrok if needed)

### Example Event Trigger Definition

```json
{
  "name": "users",
  "table": {
    "schema": "public",
    "name": "users"
  },
  "webhook_path": "/api/events/users",
  "insert": {
    "columns": "*"
  },
  "update": {
    "columns": "*"
  },
  "delete": {
    "columns": "*"
  },
  "retry_conf": {
    "num_retries": 3,
    "interval_sec": 15,
    "timeout_sec": 60
  }
}
```

The security header with `HASURA_EVENT_SECRET` will be automatically added during synchronization - you don't need to specify it in your event definition files.

For more information on Event Triggers, see the [Hasura Event Triggers documentation](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/event-triggers/index/).

### Creating Custom Event Handlers

To create a custom event handler for a specific trigger:

1. Copy the default handler from `app/api/events/[name]/route.ts` to a new file such as `app/api/events/my-trigger-name/route.ts`
2. Modify the new file to implement your custom logic in the handler function
3. Make sure your event trigger definition in the `events/` directory has a matching `webhook_path` that points to your handler (e.g., `/api/events/my-trigger-name`)

Example custom handler:

```typescript
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { hasyxEvent, HasuraEventPayload } from 'hasyx/lib/events';

export const POST = hasyxEvent(async (payload: HasuraEventPayload) => {
  // Your custom logic here
  const { event, table } = payload;
  const { op, data } = event;
  
  // Example: Log to console and perform different actions based on operation type
  console.log(`Handling ${op} operation on ${table.schema}.${table.name}`);
  
  if (op === 'INSERT') {
    // Handle insert operation
    const newRecord = data.new;
    // Do something with the new record...
  }
  
  return { success: true, message: 'Custom handler processed event' };
});
```
